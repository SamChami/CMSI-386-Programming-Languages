### 1. Given the C++ declaration:
```C++
struct {
  int n;
  char c;
} A[10][10];
```
### On your machine, find the address of A[0][0] and A[3][7]. Explain why these values are what you found them to be.

>For the array's first value at A[0][0], the memory address is randomly allocated. Consider the values to be A[x][y]. The natural allocation of memory looks like this:  
[0][0]  
[0][1]  
.  
.  
[0][9]  
[1][0]  
.  
.  
[9][8]  
[9][9]  
(The pointer for [0][10] points to the same memory address as the pointer for [1][0]. However, [0][10] is not within the size of the array.)  
When y is incremented by 1, 8 in hexadecimal is added to the memory address to allocate memory for a char's size, which is 8 bits. When x is incremented by 1, the memory is still allocated for the 10 y's that belong to the previous x value. For that reason, the memory address when x is incremented by 1 increases by 50 in hexadecimal (8 * a in hex is 50. a(hex) = 10(dec)).  
In one iteration on the computer,   
**A[0][0] is addressed at 0x5604fe8101c0** and **A[3][7] is addressed at 0x5604fe8102e8**.   
The latter storage location has 108 more hexadecimal digits than its former (hex: 50 * 2 + 8 * 7 = 108).

### 2. Explain the meaning of the following C++ declarations:
```C++
double *a[n];       //a
double (*b)[n];     //b
double (*c[n])();   //c
double (*d())[n];   //d
```
>a. The asterisk (*) symbol denotes pointers in C++. Therefore, this is declaring an array of n pointers which point to doubles.  
b. The (*b) value is a pointer to an array of doubles. [n] is the amount of doubles in the array.  
c. Inside the initial parenthesis, there is an array of pointers. These pointers point to functions that all return doubles.  
d. The first thing that should be read is a function d(), which returns a pointer. This pointer points to an array of n doubles.

### 3. Consider the following declaration in C++:
```C++
double (*f(double (*)(double, double[]), double)) (double, ...);
```
### Describe rigorously, in English, the type of f.

>**f** is a function **passing** a pointer to a function **( passing** a double and an array of doubles **returning** a double **)** and a double **returning** a pointer to a function **( passing** an indefinite number of doubles as arguments **returning** a double **)**.

### 4. What happens when we “redefine” a field in a C++ subclass? For example, suppose we have:
```C++
class Base {
public:
  int a;
  std::string b;
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
  float c;
  int b;
};
```
### Does the representation of a Derived object contain one b field or two? If two, are both accessible, or only one? Under what circumstances? Tell the story of how things are.

> The representation of a Derived object contains two b fields and both are accessible. It is possible to access base class fields (std::string b) using the scope resolution operator (::) even if they are made hidden by a derived class field (int b). For example if we created a Derived object d, we could access its b field by just saying d.b or we could access its inherited Base b field by saying d.Base::b. This is because when a C++ subclass defines a field that already has a defined field with the same name in the base class it simply uses the one it defines as default and hides the base one.

### 5. What does the following C++ program output?
```C++
#include <iostream>
int x = 2;
void f() { std::cout << x << '\n'; }
void g() { int x = 5; f(); std::cout << x << '\n'; }
int main() {
  g();
  std::cout << x << '\n';
}
```
### Verify that the answer you obtained is the same that would be inferred from apply the rules of static scoping. If C++ used dynamic scoping, what would the output have been?

> The program outputs  
2  
5

In C++, functions first check for variables on the closest scope and then look outwards because the language is statically scoped. In f(), there is no locally declared integers named x. Therefore, when x is called, the function looks to the next outward scope and finds the globally declared x. The main method looks globally as well because x is not declared within main. In g(), integer x is declared locally, and therefore, when x is called, it refers to the local integer x.  
If C++ was dynamically scoped, the output would be  
5  
5  
2  
Since f() is called within g(), it would look for variables first locally and then within g(). This is because in a dynamically scoped language, the function looks to the scope in which the function was called so long as variables aren't declared locally.

### 6. Suppose you were asked to write a function to scramble (shuffle) a given array, in a mutable fashion. Give the function signature for a shuffle function for (a) a raw array, and (b) a std::array.
a.
```C++
char[] shuffle(char[] inputs, int length)
)
```
```C++
std::array shuffle(const std::array<char, size>)
```
